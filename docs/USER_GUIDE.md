## Walk vs Bike Mode

### Toggle Between Modes
Use the Walk ðŸš¶ / Bike ðŸš´ toggle in the header

### Walk Mode
- Shows 5/10/15 minute walking accessibility
- Based on pedestrian network (sidewalks, paths)
- Displays walkability score
- Smaller reachable areas

### Bike Mode  
- Shows 5/10/15 minute biking accessibility
- Based on cycling network (bike lanes, low-traffic streets)
- Displays bikeability score
- Larger reachable areas

### Network-Based vs Radius
- **Network-based** (preferred): Follows actual street network, shows realistic accessibility
- **Radius estimate** (fallback): Simple circles if network API unavailable
- Legend indicates which method is active

---

## Dashboard Modes

### Scores Tab
- View all performance metrics
- Read AI-powered recommendation
- See amenity count and distribution
- Export analysis as PDF

### Scenario Tab
- Configure building characteristics

## Understanding Scores

### Walkability Score (0-100)
- **Excellent (80-100)**: Outstanding pedestrian access, daily needs within walk
- **Good (60-79)**: Strong walkability, most amenities accessible
- **Fair (40-59)**: Moderate access, some amenities within reach
- **Poor (0-39)**: Limited walkability, car-dependent

### Bikeability Score (0-100)
- **Excellent (80-100)**: Extensive bike infrastructure, highly bikeable
- **Good (60-79)**: Good cycling facilities, safe bike access
- **Fair (40-59)**: Some bike infrastructure, moderate cycling conditions
- **Poor (0-39)**: Limited bike facilities, challenging for cyclists

### Transit Score (0-100)
- **Excellent (80-100)**: Multiple transit options nearby, frequent service
- **Good (60-79)**: Good transit access, regular service
- **Fair (40-59)**: Some transit available, may require transfers
- **Poor (0-39)**: Limited transit, infrequent service

---

## Environmental Impact Metrics

### VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)
- **Daily VMT per Capita**: Average miles driven per person per day
- **Annual VMT**: Total miles driven by all residents per year
- **Reduction**: Percentage below California baseline (20.8 mi/capita/day)

### GHG (Greenhouse Gas Emissions)
- **Annual CO2e**: Total emissions in metric tons per year
- **Reduction**: Percentage below baseline
- **Cars Removed**: Equivalent number of cars off the road
- **Trees Planted**: Equivalent carbon absorption

---

## TDM Programs

### Categories

**Infrastructure**: Physical facilities that enable alternatives to driving
- Bike parking, car share spaces, EV charging

**Pricing & Incentives**: Financial programs that discourage driving
- Unbundled parking, transit subsidies, parking cash-out

**Programs & Services**: Organizational support for alternative travel
- Carpool matching, telecommute support, flexible hours

**Policy & Design**: Site design and regulations that reduce VMT
- Reduced parking ratios, transit-oriented design, complete streets

### Effectiveness
- Each program shows its VMT reduction percentage
- Programs are cumulative
- Site context bonus amplifies effectiveness (up to +25%)
- Based on published research and CARB guidelines

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch amenities"
- Overpass API may be rate-limited (wait a few minutes)
- Try a different address
- Check internet connection

### Scores seem low
- Rural areas naturally have lower scores
- Consider bike mode for better accessibility
- Review nearby amenities in legend

### PDF export not working
- Check browser allows downloads
- Disable popup blockers
- Try a different browser
