## 🚀 **TO DEPLOY PAID VERSION SEPARATELY**

### Option 1: Separate Vercel Project (Recommended)
This keeps them completely separate:

1. Create new Vercel project for paid version
2. Link to `paid-version` branch
3. Deploy with Stripe environment variables
4. Gets its own URL (e.g., transitscore-3d-pro.vercel.app)

### Option 2: Custom Domain
- Deploy paid version to: pro.transitscore.com
- Keep free version at: transitscore-3d.vercel.app

---

## 💡 **WHY SEPARATE DEPLOYMENTS?**

### Keeps Things Simple:
✅ Free version: Always accessible, no confusion  
✅ Paid version: Clear it's a different product  
✅ No middleware conflicts  
✅ Easier to manage  
✅ Different analytics  

### Clear Value Proposition:
- Free: "Try it now, no signup!"
- Paid: "Upgrade to Pro for $20/month"

When ready to launch paid tier:

4. You'll have two distinct products:

   - Pro tier at separate URL
