## üéØ Quick Navigation

### New to the Project?
Start here in this order:
1. [README.md](README.md) - Understand what the project does
2. [docs/USER_GUIDE.md](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) - Learn how to use it
3. [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) - See what it can do

### Want to Deploy?
Follow this path:
1. [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) - Main deployment guide
2. [docs/NETWORK_ANALYSIS.md](docs/NETWORK_ANALYSIS.md) - Set up network routing (important!)
3. [docs/PAID_VERSION.md](docs/PAID_VERSION.md) - If deploying the paid version

### Want to Contribute?
Read these docs:
1. [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contribution guidelines
2. [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Code structure
3. [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) - API reference
4. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - Recent changes

### Troubleshooting?
Check these resources:

- [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) - API-related questions
- [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) - Current known issues and roadmap

## üìù Documentation Principles

This documentation follows these principles:

### Evergreen
- No temporal references (e.g., "final", "complete", "v1.1.0")
- Version-specific information goes in CHANGELOG.md only
- Documentation updated with each feature release
- No "as of date X" statements

### Organized
- Clear folder structure (root vs docs/)
- Each file has a single, well-defined purpose
- Cross-references between related docs
- Consistent formatting and structure

### Comprehensive
- Covers all aspects of the application
- Includes examples and code snippets
- Provides troubleshooting guidance
- Keeps pace with code changes

### Maintainable
- Easy to update when features change
- Clear ownership and structure
- Minimal duplication
- Self-documenting where possible

## üîÑ Keeping Documentation Updated

When adding new features:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add entry under `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Update relevant docs**:
   - User-facing features ‚Üí `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` and `docs/FEATURES.md`
   - New API routes ‚Üí `docs/API.md`
   - Architecture changes ‚Üí `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Deployment changes ‚Üí `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **Update STATUS.md** - Add to feature list or roadmap
4. **Update README.md** - If it affects quick start or overview

When releasing a version:

1. Move `[Unreleased]` changes to new version section in CHANGELOG.md
2. Update STATUS.md if deployment URLs or structure changed
3. No need to update other docs (they're version-agnostic)

## ‚úÖ Documentation Best Practices

### Do:
- ‚úÖ Write clearly and concisely
- ‚úÖ Include code examples
- ‚úÖ Provide troubleshooting steps
- ‚úÖ Link to related documentation
- ‚úÖ Update docs with code changes
- ‚úÖ Keep formatting consistent

### Don't:
- ‚ùå Use temporal language ("final", "complete", "as of today")
- ‚ùå Duplicate information across multiple files
- ‚ùå Leave outdated information
- ‚ùå Create version-specific docs (use CHANGELOG instead)
- ‚ùå Scatter docs across the project (use docs/ folder)
