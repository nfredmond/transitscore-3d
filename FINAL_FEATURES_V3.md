## 🗺️ **NETWORK ANALYSIS EXPLAINED**

### What Changed:
**BEFORE**: Simple radius circles
- 400m, 800m, 1200m circles
- Ignores streets, barriers, rivers
- Overstates accessibility

**AFTER**: True street network
- Follows actual walkable/bikeable routes
- Accounts for barriers (freeways, rivers, etc.)
- Shows realistic reachable areas
- Organic purple/yellow/green shapes like your example!

### How It Works:
1. When you click "Analyze Site":
   - **Walking isochrone**: Calculates 5/10/15 min walk areas using sidewalk network
   - **Biking isochrone**: Calculates 5/10/15 min bike areas using bike-accessible streets
2. Both are calculated simultaneously and stored
3. Toggle walk/bike to switch between them
4. Map automatically updates with correct network areas

### Data Source:
- **OpenRouteService API** (free tier, 2000 requests/day)
- Real routing based on OpenStreetMap data
- Considers walk/bike speeds, street types, surfaces

---

## 📐 **DETAILED METHODOLOGY**

### VMT Calculations
**Base**: California average = 20.8 miles/capita/day

**Reductions Apply**:
- High walkability (70+): up to -30%
- Good bikeability (60+): up to -15%
- Strong transit (60+): up to -25%
- TDM programs: varies by program
- **Site context bonus**: up to +25% amplification

### GHG Calculations
- **0.89 lbs CO2e per vehicle mile**
- **2.5 people per household** (CA average)
- **Annual car emissions**: 4.6 tons CO2e
- **Tree absorption**: 48 lbs CO2/year

### TDM Program Effectiveness
Based on research studies:
- Most effective: Unbundled parking (-5%), Transit subsidy (-6.5%), Reduced parking (-7%)
- Infrastructure: Bike facilities, Car share, EV charging
- Programs: Telecommute, Carpool, Flexible hours
- **Cumulative**: Programs stack but with realistic caps
