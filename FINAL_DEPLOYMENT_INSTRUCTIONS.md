## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED (2 Steps - 5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add OpenRouteService API Key to Vercel

**Why?** The network-based isochrones need the ORS API key in Vercel's environment.

**How:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/green-dot-transportation-solutions/transitscore-3d/settings/environment-variables

2. Click "Add New" variable:
   ```
   Name: OPENROUTE_SERVICE_API_KEY
   Value: eyJvcmciOiI1YjNjZTM1OTc4NTExMTAwMDFjZjYyNDgiLCJpZCI6IjAwNGQ4OGU2M2FmZDRiYTRiZTU0MjBiZTA1ODI5ZmFiIiwiaCI6Im11cm11cjY0In0=
   
   Environments: ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development (check all)
   ```

3. Click "Save"

4. **Redeploy** to pick up the new env var:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/green-dot-transportation-solutions/transitscore-3d
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click the three dots (...) next to the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Check "Use existing Build Cache" (faster)
   - Click "Redeploy"

**Result:** Network-based isochrones will work! Map legend will show "✓ Network-based" instead of "~ Radius estimate"

---

### Step 2: Deploy Paid Version

The paid-version branch is ready but GitHub is blocking the push due to an old API key in git history.

**Option A: Allow the Secret (Easiest - 1 Minute)**
1. Click: https://github.com/nfredmond/transitscore-3d/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34De68DC0HdZKHnRkHez4REvEzo
2. Click "Allow secret" or "Skip this check"
3. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Code\Planning App"
   git checkout paid-version
   git push origin paid-version
   ```

**Option B: Deploy Without Pushing to GitHub**
```bash
cd "C:\Code\Planning App"
git checkout paid-version
vercel deploy --prod
```
Then add the OPENROUTE_SERVICE_API_KEY to Vercel as in Step 1.

## 🧪 Testing Your Upgrades

Once you've added the ORS API key to Vercel:

### Test Network Analysis:
1. Go to: https://transitscore-3d.vercel.app
2. Search: "1075 W Capitol Ave, West Sacramento, CA"
3. Click "Analyze Site"
4. **Look at the map** - You should see irregular polygon shapes (not circles!)
5. **Check the legend** - Should say "✓ Network-based"

### Test New Features:
1. **Scenario Comparison:**
   - Switch to "Scenario" tab
   - Configure a building
   - Click "Save" button
   - Change settings
   - Click "Save" again
   - Click "Compare (2)" button
   - See side-by-side comparison!

2. **Loading Progress:**
   - Search a new address
   - Watch the multi-step progress bar
   - See: Geocoding → Amenities → Isochrones → AI Analysis

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Try an invalid address
   - See enhanced error message
   - Click "Try again" button

4. **Mobile:**
   - Open on phone
   - Check responsive layout
   - Touch-friendly buttons
   - Abbreviated labels
