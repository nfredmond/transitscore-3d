## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Test scenario save/compare flow
- [ ] Trigger rate limiting (30+ requests in 1 min)
- [ ] Test error boundaries (temporarily break a component)
- [ ] Verify cache hits in dev console
- [ ] Test retry logic (disconnect network mid-request)
- [ ] Verify animations work smoothly
- [ ] Test dark mode toggle
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with screen reader

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Lighthouse score (aim for 90+)
- [ ] Test on slow 3G connection
- [ ] Verify cache reduces server load
- [ ] Monitor API rate limit headers

## Remaining Todos (Optional Future Enhancements)

The following features from the original plan were not implemented as they require significant additional development:

1. **Polygon Drawing** - Custom building footprints (needs Leaflet.draw integration)
2. **Batch Analysis** - CSV import for multiple addresses (needs queue system)
3. **History Tracking** - Supabase-based analysis history (needs new DB table)
4. **Map Clustering** - Marker clustering for dense areas (needs leaflet.markercluster)
5. **Touch Gestures** - Advanced mobile gestures (needs touch handlers)
6. **Analytics** - Privacy-friendly tracking (needs Plausible integration)

These can be tackled in future sprints based on user feedback and priorities.
