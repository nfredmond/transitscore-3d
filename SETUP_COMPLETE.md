## 🚀 Test the Application

Try these Sacramento addresses:

1. **Downtown Sacramento** (High walkability)
   - `1400 K St, Sacramento, CA`

2. **Capitol Area**
   - `1500 Capitol Ave, Sacramento, CA`

3. **Midtown**
   - `2000 L St, Sacramento, CA`

### What to Expect:

1. **Address Search** → Enter address and click "Analyze Site"
2. **Map Loading** → Interactive map with walkability rings appears
3. **Amenities Display** → Markers for transit, food, parks, schools, etc.
4. **Scores Calculated** → Walkability, Transit, Density, Sustainability scores
5. **AI Recommendation** → Claude-powered density analysis
6. **3D View** → Switch to see building massing with adjustable heights

- Context-aware recommendations
- Intelligent density suggestions
- Reasoning based on site characteristics

### 📈 Scoring Dashboard
- **Walkability Score** (0-100) - Based on amenity variety and quantity
- **Transit Access Score** (0-100) - Based on proximity to transit stops
- **Density Potential** - Suggested unit count
- **Sustainability Score** - Combined walkability + transit

### 💾 Data Persistence
- Analysis results logged to Supabase
- Amenity data cached for 24 hours
- Analytics on site searches

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### `/api/geocode`
- **Method**: GET
- **Params**: `address` (string)
- **Returns**: `{ lat, lng, address, city }`
- **Purpose**: Convert Sacramento address to coordinates

### `/api/amenities`
- **Method**: GET
- **Params**: `lat` (number), `lng` (number)
- **Returns**: `{ amenities[], count }`
- **Purpose**: Fetch nearby amenities from Overpass API

### `/api/analyze`
- **Method**: POST
- **Body**: `{ address, lat, lng, amenities[] }`
- **Returns**: `{ scores, recommendation, suggestedUnits, reasoning[] }`
- **Purpose**: AI-powered density analysis using Claude

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ API keys stored securely in Vercel environment variables
- ✅ Row-level security (RLS) enabled on Supabase tables
- ✅ No user authentication required (public tool)
- ✅ No personal data collected
- ✅ HTTPS encryption on all endpoints

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Build Time**: ~40 seconds
- **Initial Load**: ~2 seconds
- **API Response**: <1 second (geocoding)
- **Amenity Fetch**: 2-5 seconds (Overpass API)
- **AI Analysis**: 3-5 seconds (Claude API)
- **Caching**: 24 hours for amenity data

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Sacramento Only**: Geocoding validates for Sacramento, CA addresses
2. **Rate Limits**: Overpass API may rate-limit on heavy use
3. **Amenity Data**: Depends on OpenStreetMap completeness
4. **3D View**: Simplified building envelope (not site-specific)

## 🎓 How It Works

### Walkability Score Calculation
- Count-based: More amenities = higher score (max 50 points)
- Diversity-based: More categories = higher score (max 50 points)
- Total: 0-100 scale

### Transit Score Calculation
- Proximity-based: Closer transit = higher score
- Quantity-based: More stops = higher score
- Weighted by distance: <400m weighted highest

### AI Recommendations
- Analyzes walkability + transit scores
- Considers amenity diversity
- Evaluates neighborhood context
- Provides reasoning and unit count suggestions
